# Solitaire
Solitaire written in godot. Available on windows, android and linux.

All art done by me. If you are asking why there are some png versions of svg, then it`s because godot didn't read svg correctly.

## What it can do

Save your game, so you can continue playing later.

Change layout and screen orientation.
